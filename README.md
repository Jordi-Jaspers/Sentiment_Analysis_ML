**Description:**
Tweets often only represent neutral information without indication to any emotion whatsoever. But via prior research and some algorithms, we could train a machine that could extract or read emotions learning from other tweets. Whereby we could past a number on the amount of happiness or sadness the message would contain. This project is part of the Machine Learning course of the KULeuven/UHasselt University. Course Information can be found on the following [Link](https://uhintra03.uhasselt.be/studiegidswww/opleidingsonderdeel.aspx?a=2019&i=4091&n=4&t=01 "ECTS Page").

## Documentation 
All the extra documentation and used datasets are located in the Project-Proposal.docx. We ARE using Python3 in this project.
